# HRC-model-set
Model set for Human-Robot collaborative tasks

## Introduction

	The Model Set for Human-Robot collaborative tasks consists of the following items :
		* A series of eight 3D printed brackets
		* Dowels
		* Plywood
		* Fasteners (Screws)

## 3D Printed Brackets

The 3D Printed Brackets were designed with three main criteria in mind : re-use, replicability, and modularity.
Each bracket was modeled in SolidWorks and then printed on a Dimension Elite FDM printer using ABS+ plastic.

The .stl files and the SolidWorks files can be found here (HRC-model-set/Bracket STL Files/) and here (HRC-model-set/Bracket SolidWorks Files/) respectively.

## Hardware

Exclusive of the 3D printed brackets, all of the hardware of the HRC Model Set can be found online, at a hardware store, or craft supply. Below are the hardware components along with a link to where you can purchase them.

1. __Wooden Dowels__ In our experiments we used 1/2" (OD) dowels from [this]( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YDLVP9C/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) assorted value pack. You can also purchase the dowels [here](https://www.amazon.com/Wooden-Dowel-Rods-12-Bag/dp/B00XQI3NJS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1488559469&sr=8-2&keywords=1%2F2%22+craft+dowel) if you do not want an assortment of sizes.
2. __Plywood__ [These](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CQKYZPI/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 12" x 12" plywood sheets were then cut on a laser cutter to size. To build the console, larger sheets found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Baltic-Birch-Plywood-Scroll-Woodpeckers/dp/B01MQTWKBX/ref=sr_1_1_m?s=arts-crafts&ie=UTF8&qid=1488566139&sr=1-1&keywords=24%22x24%22%2Bcraft%2Bplywood&th=1) can be used.
3. __Screws__ #4 screws in 1/4" lengths can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HAEX8C0/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and #4 screws in 1/2" lengths can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OKIT234/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). These screws are both phillips head screws, however it is possible to find screws with different drive heads as well.

## CAD- 3D Modeling
With access to the SolidWorks files, making adjustments to fit plywood and dowels of various lengths or widths requires a few simple steps.

## 3D Printing

Below are some guidelines to use when printing out a file using some common 3D printers:
