# HRC-model-set
Model set for Human-Robot collaborative tasks

## Introduction

	*The Model Set for Human-Robot collaborative tasks consists of the following items :
		* A series of eight 3D printed brackets 
		* Dowels and Plywood
		* Fasteners 

## 3D Printed Brackets

The 3D Printed Brackets were designed with three main criteria in mind : re-use, replicability, and modularity.
Each bracket was modeled in SolidWorks and then printed on a Dimension Elite FDM printer using ABS+ plastic. 

The .stl files and the SolidWorks files can be found here (HRC-model-set/Bracket STL Files/) and here (HRC-model-set/Bracket SolidWorks Files/) respectively. 

## Hardware 

Exclusive of the 3D printed brackets, all of the hardware of the HRC Model Set can be found online, at a hardware store, or craft supply. Below are the hardware components along with a link to where you can purchase them.
