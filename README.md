# HRC-model-set
Model set for Human-Robot collaborative tasks

## Introduction

The Model Set for Human-Robot collaborative tasks consists of the following items :
	* A series of eight 3D printed brackets 
	* Dowels and Plywood
	* Fasteners 

## 3D Printed Brackets

The 3D Printed Brackets were designed with three main criteria in mind : re-use, replicability, and modularity.
Each bracket was modeled in SolidWorks and then printed on a Dimension Elite FDM printer using ABS+ plastic. 

The .stl files and the SolidWorks files can be found here (HRC-model-set/Bracket STL Files/) and here (HRC-model-set/Bracket SolidWorks Files/) respectively. 

## Dowels and Plywood
