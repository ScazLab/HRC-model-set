The human-robot collaboration (HRC) model set is intended to ease the design of human-robot collaboration experiments.
It targets scenarios like the collaborative assembly of furniture, and consists of a combination of standard components and custom designs, that are:

 * A series of eight 3D printed [brackets]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/brackets)
 * [Dowels]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/dowels-screws-plywood)
 * [Plywood]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/dowels-screws-plywood)
 * [Fasteners (Screws)]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/dowels-screws-plywood)

The model set aims at reducing the amount of work required to set up and reproduce HRC experiments.
It is designed to be modular, extendable, and easy to distribute. All the content of this repository is distributed under the [Creative Commons attribution-sharealike 4.0 international public license (CC-by-sa)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode).
